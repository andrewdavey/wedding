                    is a visitor attraction and World Heritage Site in Cornwall, built around an old Engine House. We're getting married in the Film Room, a converted space inside one of the old mining buildings. It's part of the exhibition rooms, next to the visitor centre.

                <p>
                    Handsome groomsmen will be on hand to help you find the room and choose a seat, but please sit wherever you like, on either side of the aisle. As the saying goes, 'choose a seat, not a side'!  The fantabulous Nathan Barrow is our photography guy during the ceremony, but feel free to take lots of pictures or videos for us the rest of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorry, <strong>no confetti</strong> allowed at Heartlands.
